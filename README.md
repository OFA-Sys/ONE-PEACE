# ONE-PEACE: Exploring One General Representation Model Toward Unlimited modalities

ONE-PEACE is a general representation model across vision, audio, and language modalities,
Without using any vision or language pretrained model for initialization, ONE-PEACE achieves leading results in vision, 
audio, audio-language, and vision-language tasks.
Furthermore, ONE-PEACE possesses a strong emergent zero-shot retrieval capability, enabling it to align modalities
that are not paired in the training data.

Below shows the architecture and pretraining tasks of ONE-PEACE.
With the scaling-friendly architecture and modality-agnostic tasks, ONE-PEACE has the potential to expand to unlimited modalities.
